## Abstract

As artificial intelligence continues to develop at a rapid rate, people have begun to worry about the substantial loss of jobs due to it. One implication that is often left unconsidered, however, is the *shift* in employment from one field to another. In the following case study, I examine Amazon’s implementation of their Just Walk Out technology and how it relocated work from in-store cashiers to exploited overseas data workers. Through covering this, I examine the broader impact of artificial intelligence on the labor market, its targeted harm on minimum-wage employees and data workers, and offer a solution moving forward.
