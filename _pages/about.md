#This page is meant for you to showcase your case study, podcasts, and blog posts reflecting on our readings. You will need to update the content in each section and submit your site to Moodle (see calendar). Once all sections are updated, revise this paragraph so it summarizes the purpose of your site for new visitors. This can include how to navigate it, what each section contains, and what someone should understand about your work just by reading this introduction.

I'm from St. Paul, Minnesota, and being from the north, my love for nature is huge. Much of my life has been spent camping, hiking, and experiencing the outdoors. I participated in Scouts for 7 years, in which I earned my Eagle Scout and served in multiple leadership positions. Along with this, I am an avid musician; playing trumpet in the St. Olaf Band and on-campus chamber music.
