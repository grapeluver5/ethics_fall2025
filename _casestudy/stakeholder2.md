Businesses should definitely be aware of the potential negative consequences of such technology as well, since they’re the ones investing in it. Firstly, many consumers are already concerned about privacy issues with revealing their shopping habits, and being under further surveillance would only add to those concerns. Amazon already uses people’s shopping history to further cater products to people, so it’s not unrealistic that they would use in-store data for the same purposes down the line. The tech would also remove yet another layer of human interaction from daily life—which I realize might seem like a positive for those who are uncomfortable with social interactions—but is still important to acknowledge on a societal scale. These reasons may drive away potential consumers, and have the adverse effect of alienating their current customer base.
