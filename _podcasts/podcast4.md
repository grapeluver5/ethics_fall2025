This week, Damien Jackson and I attempt to write an episode of Black Mirror while referencing some upcoming technology (specifically AI twins and self-driving technology). Although neither of us have seen an episode of Black Mirror, we still had a good time trying to come up with a workable plot. Please enjoy this episode; it was a lot of fun!
